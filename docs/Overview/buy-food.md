# Buying food and Time Of Death (TOD)

The premise of the game is to take care of your pet, on your pet page you will see different food options with scores and a timer of your "TOD" (Time Of Death). 

Time Of Death (TOD) is when your pet will die if it's not fed, if your pet dies your NFT is burned and you can't revive it or use it again.

You buy food by paying in $FP Tokens.

Give your pet foods according to your strategy and feeling, you can be agressive to raise in the leaderboard or just calm giving your pet an apple every 3 days.

**Note that your TOD (Time Of Death) never adds up, each new food you give your pet resets the TOD to that food's specific TOD properties**
